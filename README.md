This project demonstrates various statistical tests, machine learning models, and visualizations using a dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to explore, analyze, and model the data to derive insights and predictions.
I applied various statistical tests and machine learning models on the dataset to explore relationships between features and predict outcomes. Several visualizations have been included to better understand the data. The project workflow includes:

Hypothesis Testing,
Supervised Machine Learning Models (Decision Trees),
Visualizations (Boxplots, Histograms)
